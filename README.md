# Simulation_protocols
Use this repo for storing protocols that are written in a form for simulation, please prefix names with SIM. APIv2 has a slightly different form for protocols that are being simulated as opposed to protocols that are being run on a robot. To make it easy for users to distinguish simulated protocols, this repo is intended to keep them separate.
Please make it clear which API version the protocols are written for by including the relevant API version at the end of the name.

Nameformat e.g.
SIM-qPCR_Master_Mix_API2-7.py
